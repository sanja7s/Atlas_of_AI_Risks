# Atlas of AI Risks
===================

This repository hosts the **[Atlas of AI Risks](https://social-dynamics.net/ai-risk-mapping-visualization2/)** project, an initiative dedicated to exploring and visualizing the various risks, benefits, and their trade-offs associated with different Artificial Intelligence technologies. The project is structured into two main components:

*   **Front-end (`visualization-code`)**: This component is responsible for the visual representation of the AI risks, making it accessible and understandable to users.
*   **Back-end (`LLM-code`)**: This component powers the underlying content and data processing, enabling the detailed analysis and presentation of AI risks.
