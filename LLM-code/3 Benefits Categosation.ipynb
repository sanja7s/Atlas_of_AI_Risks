These are routinely evaluated in isolation, including tests of AI system behavior in response to novel tasks or environments, or testing individual technical artefacts, such as the data that an AI system is trained on. It also includes evaluating processes by which these artefacts are created, such as the aggregation mechanisms in processes that are used to adapt an AI system to a particular task.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Human Interaction: targets the experience of people interacting with a given AI system. This includes usability: does the AI system perform its intended function at the point of use, and how do experiences differ between user groups? This layer also centres potential externalities: does human–AI interaction lead to unintended effects on the person interacting or exposed to AI outputs? Evaluation at this layer acknowledges that AI system safety depends on who uses an AI system, with what goal in mind, and in what context.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Systemic Impact: targets the impact of an AI system on the broader systems in which it is embedded, such as society, the economy, and the natural environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        and for the second axis, they are distinguished by the stakeholder:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * AI User: The entity or individual in charge of deploying and managing the AI system, including individuals, organizations, corporations, public authorities, and agencies responsible for its operation and management\n",
    "\n",
    "        * AI Subject: The individual directly affected by the use of the AI system, experiencing its effects and consequences. They interact with or are impacted by the AI system's processes, decisions, or outcomes,\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Institutions, General Public and Environment: includes societal and nature elements affected by the AI system use.\n",

    "        NB: It is very important that each \"Benefit Description\" you create be formatted like this: Verb + Object + [Explanation], and is concise, consisting of one clear, to-the-point sentence, with up to maximum of 20 words.\n",

    "          Also, we want these descriptions to be read by broad public who does not have a deep knowledge about Human Rights or Sustainable Development Goals. Hence, we want descriptions without any mention of specific Human Right Article IDs, or Sustainable Development Goal Targets and Indicators. For instance, these two are NOT good outputs: 1) \"Promotes goal 17 by recognizing and highlighting their performances.\" and 2) \"Promotes the enhancement of North-South, South-South and triangular regional and international cooperation on and access to science, technology and innovation.\", and these two, instead, are good: 1) \"Promotes the social inclusion of all athletes by recognizing and highlighting their performances.\", and 2) \"Promotes regional and international cooperation on and access to science, technology and innovation.\"\n",

    "      Finally, and crucially, examine the benefits you have identified for this specific AI use to ensure their uniqueness. Specifically, if a benefit is initially categorized under both 'Capability' and 'Human Interaction' or any other overlapping categories from the Axis 1, select the most appropriate single category for it. Exclude it from any additional categories. By maintaining a distinct benefit set for each AI use, assign unique Benefit Identifiers (BIDs) accordingly (this should be only numbers).
