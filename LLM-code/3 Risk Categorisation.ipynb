    "\n",
    "        (1) Capability: targets AI systems, their technical components, and the processes by which these systems and components are created, including:​\n",
    "          (a) Outputs of an AI system, for example, model performance, efficiency metrics such as energy use, the extent to which an AI model reproduces harmful stereotypes, factual errors, or displays advanced capabilities that present safety hazards,​\n",
    "          (b) The data on which a model is trained, for example, the diversity and representativeness of the data, the presence of sensitive data, the learned associations of a trained AI system,​\n",
    "          (c) Filters and techniques for reducing system harms, for example, filters for toxic language.​\n",
    "\n",
    "        (2) Human Interaction: targets the experience of people interacting with AI systems and their effects on these people, including:​\n",
    "          (a) The system's usability, for example, whether the AI system performs its intended function at the point of use, how experiences differ between user groups, and how easy it is to use a model for malicious ends,​\n",
    "          (b) Potential externalities, for example, whether human-AI interaction leads to unintended effects on the person interacting with or exposed to AI outputs, such as overreliance on AI systems, overtrust, and cognitive biases,​\n",
    "          (c) Potential harms, including harms to data annotators and harms arising from different system modalities (e.g., video, image, text),​\n",
    "          (d) The overall quality of outcomes in human-AI assisted tasks compared to human-human assisted tasks.​\n",
    "\n",
    "        (3) Systemic Impact: targets the impact of an AI system on the broader systems in which it is embedded, such as society, the economy, and the natural environment, including:​\n",
    "          (a) Systems of various domains, sizes, industries, or goods,​\n",
    "          (b) Adoption and perception of AI across different systems,​\n",
    "          (c) Distribution of benefits and risks from the AI,​\n",
    "          (d) Environmental impacts of the AI on the systems, e.g., biodiversity and resilience of local ecosystems.​\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        and for the second axis, they are distinguished by the stakeholder who is impacted:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * AI User: The entity or individual in charge of deploying and managing the AI system, including individuals, organizations, corporations, public authorities, and agencies responsible for its operation and management;\n",
    "        * AI Subject: The individual directly affected by the use of the AI system, experiencing its effects and consequences. They interact with or are impacted by the AI system's processes, decisions, or outcomes;\n",
    "        * Institutions, General Public and Environment: includes societal and nature elements affected by the AI system use.\n",
    "\n",
    "      NB: It is very important that each \"Risk Description\" you create be formatted like this: Verb + Object + [Explanation], and is concise, consisting of one clear, to-the-point sentence, with up to maximum of 20 words.\n",
    "          Specifically, start with an action verb in active present tense (e.g., undermines, discriminates, infringes, reduces, increases but NOT potentially) followed by the object and the reason in case it is not obvious and requires an explanation. Since we are talking about potential risks in general, there is no need to use the word potentially anywhere. Hence, this would NOT be a good output: \"Potentially undermines the right to privacy if the facial recognition data is not properly secured.\" while this is good: \"Undermines the right to privacy if the facial recognition data is not properly secured.\"\n",
    "          Also, we want these descriptions to be read by broad public who does not have a deep knowledge about Human Rights or Sustainable Development Goals. Hence, we want descriptions without any mention of specific Human Right Article IDs, or Sustainable Development Goal Targets and Indicators. For instance, this is NOT a good output: \"Undermines target 11.3 by controlling public spaces without democratic civil society participation.\", and this is, instead, good: \"Controls public spaces without democratic civil society participation.\".\n",
    "\n",
    "        Other examples of well-formatted \"Risk Descriptions\":\n",
    "        \n",
    "        * Discriminates against certain players, such as women or those from certain ethnic backgrounds.\n",
    "        * Leads to job losses in the transportation sector, particularly among drivers, if it results in increased automation and reduced need for human drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Ensure to include ALL the input risks, unless there are duplicates across risks that impact SDGs and human rights, in which case, merge them into a single risk. Sometimes, the input includes both risks and benefits for a use together. In that case, make sure to extract only the risks. For example:\n",
    "            If in INPUT you had: \"The AI system supports social, economic, and political inclusion by providing a tool that can be used by anyone, regardless of their background, to improve their personal growth. However, it could potentially undermine this by reinforcing biases in facial recognition technology.\",\n",
    "            You should extract and include as a risk description ONLY the following part: \"Undermines social, economic, and political inclusion by reinforcing biases in facial recognition technology.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "      Finally, and crucially, examine the risks you have identified for this specific AI use to ensure their uniqueness. Specifically, if a risk is initially categorized under both 'Capability' and 'Human Interaction' or any other overlapping categories from the Axis 1, select the most appropriate single category for it. Exclude it from any additional categories. By maintaining a distinct risk set for each AI use, assign unique Risk Identifiers (RIDs) accordingly (this should be only numbers). Subsequently, for comprehensive tracking, we will generate a universal Risk Identifier for all AI uses by incorporating the Use Identifier (UseID) provided in input, in the following structure: \"UseID-RID\".\n",
